characters are from 1 - 10, with a possible future expansion to 20
each class has 5 ranks of features, when creating a character players will be required to select 2 classes
once the classes are selected the player must select one class to be the leading class, denoted as 1st , the other will become a secondary class, denoted as 2nd


class selection:
  once you have selected your race and background choose 2 different classes,
        of those 2 choose one to be the leading class(1st), the other becomes the secondary class(2nd),
                                                this doesn't affect the features gained from the class
